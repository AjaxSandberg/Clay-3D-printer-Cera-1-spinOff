Download and Install the mainsail/klipper OS onto a raspberry Pi. Once done, ssh into it to reset passwords and find its IP address. 
Then navigate to btt-cb1.local in a web browser while the pi is on and running. This will launch mainsail and klipper. Now you can access the files for the printer. 

Printer.cfg is the main configuration file for the printer that I am using. You may need to edit specific pin locations if you change the wiring, 
but this is what I have found to work for my setup. 

OrderedPointsGHpython is a custom script that can be plugged into GHpython component in grasshopper to take a list of curves and divide it into a list of points and arrange 
the order such that a printer can follow continuous lines. Those points can be made into G-Code using concatenate and then constructing your own custom G-code parser. 

SaveFile.py allows you to input a file path and save the g-code to that path. There is no standalone component in grasshopper that does this so this was the easiest way to do it. 

GcodeSlicerEXAMPLE.gh is a grasshopper file (the exact one that I use) that slices my lines to Gcode that I can send to my printer. 
(check out my other git repo to see how to do this in real time)
